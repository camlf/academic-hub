    "The OSIsoft Academic Hub is a cloud-based platform that enables experiential learning with industrial process datasets. Students use the Academic Hub to gain experience in solving real-world problems with real-world data. Students gain experience in several areas that help to prepare them for careers in today’s workplace:\n",

    "OSIsoft’s technology provides customers with the tools for real-time data management of their operational data. Operational data is data that reflects the physical state of an industrial asset (or “thing”). There are many sources and types of data in operations; real-time process control data, sensor and device data; machine-generated data, asset data, web data, weather data, heat map data, and many more. One of the unique types of operational data is time-series data, where time is the index. For over forty years OSIsoft has been at the forefront of time series data collection and aggregation, along with other types of operational data, allowing people to contextualize and federate large volumes of industrial, operational data. With 65% of industrial Fortune 500 customers using OSIsoft products to monitor over two billion data streams globally, it is likely engineers will work with an OSIsoft product during their career. Data analysis and specifically time series data analysis skills are quickly becoming a standard requirement for engineers and managers alike. OSIsoft data is ready to integrate into sophisticated visualization tools, industry applications and AI/ML platforms in use today globally.\n",

    "Predictive models of the process can be valuable to industry, as students saw with the ADF Prediction model which saved Deschutes Brewery upwards of $750,000 in capital investment. In the [Beer Cooling Prediction Exercise](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb), students will have to use domain knowledge of the brewing process and the physics involved (e.g. heat transfer) to model the temperature profile during the cooling stages.\n",

In the real world, the majority of the time and effort for data analytis is spent wrangling the data first by dealing with missing or mislabeled entries, and then transforming the data into a format where regression analysis can be applied.\n",
