    "\n",
    "Deschutes Brewery has identified the problems that are critical to their organization's performance. Students will take on two sets of problems Deschutes identified: one is to predict Apparent Degree of Fermentation (ADF), and another is to predict the cooling temperature profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a few reasons, predicting the ADF, which describes the fermentation status, is important. The automated measurement of gravity of wort is costly, and without it, this becomes a manual and time-consuming process. Being able to predict ADF will translate to the significant savings in time devoted to measuring ADF and saving the opportunity cost of implementing the automated instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a predictive model for the cooling temperature profile is also valuable because students can easily predict the entire cooling temperature profile, given the initial temperature of the solution. Also, this simple model can be used to examine the data quality by determining whether the cooling phase is labeled as cooling phase, not other phases.\n",

That the dataset contains some poor-quality data inevitably give students the opportunity to work with \"dirty data\" and clean the data for ease of analysis. There are multiple reasons that result in these poor-quality data: 1) error between the data source sending the data to the data store, 2) the poor quality data during the data collection can have a trickle-down effect when they are involved in calculations,  3) the mislabeled or incorrect data stored manually, 4) and the missing data.  \n",

    "With the current version of Data View software, all the above data problem (exception mislabeled ones) will manifest themselves as missing data (empty string) in the results returned by a data view. Rows with missing data can be discarded from a Pandas dataframe by calling the `.dropna()` method. Some exercises require this method for data preparation. \n",
