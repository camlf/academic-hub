    "Deschutes Brewery identified the problems that are critical to their organization's performance. Students will take on two sets of problems Deschutes identified: one is to predict Apparent Degree of Fermentation (ADF), and another is to predict the cooling temperature profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting the ADF, which describes the fermentation status, is important. There are currently two options - implementing automated instrumentation or performing the task manually. The automated measurement of gravity of wort is costly, and without it, this becomes a manual and time-consuming process. Being able to predict ADF will translate to the significant savings in time devoted to measuring ADF and save the cost of implementing the automated instrumentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a predictive model for the cooling temperature profile is also valuable because students can easily predict the entire cooling temperature profile, given the initial temperature of the solution. This simple model can then be used to examine the data quality by determining whether the cooling phase is indentified and correctly labled as cooling phase and not another phase.\n",

    "Though there are twenty-nine fermenters, students will focus on only fermenters 31 to 36 because they contain the most complete datasets for analysis. Even fermenters 31 to 36 have imperfect data streams, referred to as \"dirty\" data. Dirty data is the result of numerous causes including: an error between the data source and the mechanism sending the data stream to the data store, propogation of poor quality data through its use in calulations, manualy data being miskeyed or mislabeled, and simply missing data. Another potential poor-quality data can come from manually recorded data, the vessel status and ADF; for example, the cooling phase could be mislabeled as the diacetyl rest phase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the current version of OSIsoft OCS software, DataViews will show all the dirty data value (except mislabeled ones) as missing data (empty string). Data cleansing must be performed before moving forward with data analysis. Data cleansing is the process of removing, editing, or adding incorrect or missing data from a raw data set. In the case of the fermenter data, the only type of data cleansing we need to perform is on missing data. Rows with missing data can be discarded from a Pandas dataframe by calling the `.dropna()` method. Some exercises require this method for data preparation. \n",
