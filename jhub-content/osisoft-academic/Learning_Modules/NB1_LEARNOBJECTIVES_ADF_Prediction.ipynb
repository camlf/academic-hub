    "OSIsoft’s technology provides customers with the tools for real-time data management of their operational data. Operational data is data that reflects the physical state of an industrial asset (or “thing”). There are many sources and types of data in operations; real-time process control data, sensor and device data; machine-generated data, asset data, web data, weather data, heat map data, and many more. One of the unique types of operational data is time-series data, where time is the index. For over forty years OSIsoft has been at the forefront of time series data collection and aggregation, along with other types of operational data, allowing people to contextualize and federate large volumes of industrial, operational data. With 65% of industrial Fortune 500 customers using OSIsoft products to monitor over two billion data streams globally, it is likely engineers will work with an OSIsoft product during their career. Data analysis and specifically time series data analysis skills are quickly becoming a standard requirement for engineers and managers alike. OSIsoft data is ready to integrate into sophisticated visualization tools, industry applications and AI/ML platforms in use today globally.\n",

In this case, the ADF prediction model saved Deschutes Brewery \\$750,000 in capital investments). Because real process data is \"dirty\", students will experience the importance of domain knowledge in being able to organize and clean the data to fit analysis goals. Furthermore, Part 4 of the exercise notebook has missing pieces of code students will have to fill in order for the notebook to run properly and produce results; this ensures that students will interact with the notebook and pay attention to how code is written.\n",
    "\n",

Remove obviously bad data points and unnecessary attributes ([4a](./NB1_EXERCISE_ADF_Prediction.ipynb#section_4a)); identify fermentation batches and compute the duration of fermentation ([4c](./NB1_EXERCISE_ADF_Prediction.ipynb#section_4c)); manually remove emergent outliers ([4e](./NB1_EXERCISE_ADF_Prediction.ipynb#section_4e)).\n",

    "1. Which of the models used in this notebook performed the best and why?\n",
