    "The Academic JupyterHub is OSIsoft private instance of [JupyterHub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a scalable, sustainable and easy to deploy multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks. It allows to deploy easily data science content to a wide audience. Instead of spending time installing required software or getting acquainted with a new virtual machine environement, students can right away start to learn, explore and experiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After logging in with their credentials (right now need a Github account member of the osisoft-academic organization), a private environment is created for the student in a few minutes, including a permanent disk, with all the content needed to perform a live teaching lab or learn with self-service modules. Only a web browser is necessary to perform all the tasks. Additional content can be dynamically added through mechanism like [nbgitpuller](https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller#what-is-it). \n",

Even small amounts of moisture entering the reaction create a highly corrosive environment that will damage and compromise the equipment metallurgy. The modelling objective is to create a temperature profile representing proper regeneration of the dryer bed which is critical to this process.\n",
