    "## Exercise Overview\n",
    "Predictive models of the process can be valuable to industry (the ADF prediction model saved Deschutes Brewery from 750k in capital investments). In this [exercise](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb), students will have to use domain knowledge of the brewing process and the physics involved (e.g. heat transfer) to model the temperature profile during the cooling stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "While non-linear regression may be trivial for more advanced engineering students, this exercise will expose them to the realities of modeling real-world industrial data, where the majority of the effort is spent wrangling the data: dealing with missing or mislabeled entries, and transforming them into a format where regression analysis could be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise notebook also has blocks of missing code which students will have to complete in order for the notebook to run properly and produce results; this ensures that students will interact with the notebook and pay attention to the algorithm and how the code is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The exercise notebook is divided into two parts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 1](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1) students will create a function `compute_cooling_prediction` which does the following:\n",
    "* Clean the data by throwing out irrelevant ([1a](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1a)) and bad ([1c](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1c)) entries\n",
    "* Identify when a fermentation event starts ([1d](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1d))  and then compute the time elapsed since the start of fermentation ([1e](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1e))\n",
    "* Identify the cooling stages ([1e](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1e)) and identify the elapsed times since the start of cooling ([1e](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1e))\n",
    "* Fit the cooling data ([1a](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1a)) to a heat transfer equation ([1f](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_1f)) \n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 2](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_2) students will execute `compute_cooling_prediction` and plot the results:\n",
    "* Use OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) to obtain process data from Deschutes Brewery ([2b](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_2b) and [2c](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_2c))\n",
    "* Execute the `compute_cooling_prediction` function created in Part 1 ([2d](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_2d))\n",
    "* Plot the cooling prediction curve using Plotly ([2e](./NB2_EXERCISE_Cooling_Prediction.ipynb#section_2e))\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the exercise, students will be asked to think about the following questions:**\n",
    " \n",
    "1. If the cooling data had outliers, how would you remove them?\n",
    "2. How would having an erratic cooling profile affect the prediction curve? \n",
    "3. Can you use the cooling prediction curve to determine whether a given batch is out-of-spec? How would you do this?\n",
