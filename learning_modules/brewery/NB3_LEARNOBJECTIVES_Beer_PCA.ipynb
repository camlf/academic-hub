    "OSIsoft’s technology provides customers with the tools for real-time data management of their operational data. Operational data is data that reflects the physical state of an industrial asset (or “thing”). There are many sources and types of data in operations; real-time process control data, sensor and device data; machine-generated data, asset data, web data, weather data, heat map data, and many more. One of the unique types of operational data is time-series data, where time is the index. For over forty years OSIsoft has been at the forefront of time series data collection and aggregation, along with other types of operational data, allowing people to contextualize and federate large volumes of industrial, operational data. With 65% of industrial Fortune 500 customers using OSIsoft products to monitor over two billion data streams globally, it is likely engineers will work with an OSIsoft product during their career. Data analysis and specifically time series data analysis skills are quickly becoming a standard requirement for engineers and managers alike. OSIsoft data is ready to integrate into sophisticated visualization tools, industry applications and AI/ML platforms in use today globally.\n",

    "## Exercise Overview\n",
    "It is often useful to be able to quickly determine whether and which of the production batches are out-of-spec. The ability to determine the origin or the cause of a process failure or a bad batch is valuable to industry. In the [Beer PCA Exercise](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb), students will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine which batches are out-of-spec without having to analyze the time series data for every attribute of each beer batch, of which there are dozens. Students will then use the properties of PCA to identify what may have caused a batch to be out-of-spec.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise notebook also has blocks of missing code which students will have to complete in order for the notebook to run properly and produce results; this ensures that students will interact with the notebook and pay attention to the algorithm and how the code is written.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**The [Beer PCA Exercise](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb) has six total sections, including a [bonus section](././NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_6).** \n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 1](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_1), specify parameters of interest like brands, fermentors, time period to analyze, time granularity, attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 2](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_2), use OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) to obtain process data from Deschutes Brewery.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 3](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_3), create utility functions for calculating the elapsed time per batch, identifying fermentation stages without relying on the \"Status\" labels, removing the bad batches, and summarizing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 4](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_4), execute the functions created in Part 3 for each brand in each fermenter vessel. Collect the summary of the data into the dataframe `FeatureDF`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 5](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_5), `FeatureDF` is a high-dimensional dataset that is not easily human-processable. Use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to obtain new components composed of linear combinations of the most \"relevant\" input features in `FeatureDF`( [5a](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_5a)-[5c](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_5c)); use those components to graphically visualize `FeatureDF` and identify the bad batches [5d](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_5d); then identify the input features which contributed to the out-of-spec characteristics of the outlier batches ([5e](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_5e)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 6 (BONUS)](./NB3_EXERCISE_Beer_PCA.ipynb#section_6), use the k-means clustering algorithm to classify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Furthermore at the end of the exercise, students will be asked to think about the following questions:** \n",
    "1. Why do you think there are bad batches?\n",
    "2. Does it seem like there is equipment failure? Process failure?\n",
    "3. What would you do to determine the root cause of a process or equipment failure?"
